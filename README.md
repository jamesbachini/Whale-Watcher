# Whale Watcher

A simple script to extract a list of addresses that interacted with a token and a Uniswap pool.

Be careful with infura api keys, don't upload them to Github.

There's a more in depth tutorial on my blog at https://jamesbachini.com

## Requires

NodeJS and Ethers + an Infura API key (free)

- https://nodejs.org

Enter a Infura API key, token contract address and a Uniswap pool address which can be found on dexscanner.

npm install ethers
